# Tempest C# Recreation

Personal C# recreation based on the gameplay behavior of Mark Incitti's Tempest 3.1 BlitzMax project.

## Initial goal
Get one tube playable with player movement, shooting, a Flipper, collision, scoring, and a fixed 60 Hz simulation.

## VS Code
Install the current .NET SDK and Microsoft's C# Dev Kit extension, then open this folder in VS Code.

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet run --project src/Tempest.Game
```

## Reference mapping
- `tempest.bmx` -> gameplay and state behavior
- `transformfunctions.bmx` -> `Rendering/Projection.cs`
- `vectorfont.bmx` -> `Rendering/VectorFont.cs`
- levelset files -> `Levels/LevelLoader.cs` / data files later
